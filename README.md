### ***Description***
##### A "Battleship" redux as a browser game. Instead of "maritime war simulation, for kids!", the intention is "competitive positivity." 
##### *General Assembly SEI Unit 1 project.*
Bubble Shift is an outlet to combat negative thoughts, feelings, experiences with a friend. The game aims to provide a sense of togetherness/"you're-not-alone"-ness while someone is vulnerable, as well as give guidance for how to rewrite or re-word these negative things into positives, or replace false things with truths and affirmations.

> "Cognitive shifting is the mental process of consciously redirecting one's attention from one fixation to another; the conscious choice to take charge of one's mental habits—and redirect one's focus of attention in helpful, more successful directions."
> 
> — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_shifting), "Cognitive Shifting"

Some aspects of depression and anxiety occur when someone's experienced, or even perceived, negatives are fixated upon. The idea of Bubble Shift is to illustrate and guide that cognitive shift off of negatives and onto positives in a gentle, colorful, whimsical, "game"-ified way.

### ***Future Updates***
- [x] ~~Review rules during game~~
- [ ] Replay button on win/loss
- [ ] Track wins/losses through replays
- [ ] Randomize option for auto-placing the player's bubbles in pre-game.
- [ ] Improve computer player's logic ("chain on" after successful hits, and then return to random firing)
- [ ] Drag and drop for bubbles instead of point-and-click-and-click.
- [ ] Add the intended catharsis elements: Instead of just circular "bubbles", they are actual thought or speech bubble images, representing negative thoughts, experiences or concepts. Popping the bubbles then represents (and the game reaffirms) that that is false or etc. (Due to the limitations of Surge deployment, this was untenable at this time.)
- [ ] With the above inclusion of bubble images, I would like there to be a "stock" of pre-generated labels the player can choose from for their bubbles if they don't want to open up about their own bothers with a user input function.
- [ ] Actual two-player funcionality.
- [ ] Optional side-by-side view of player's and opponent's maps.
- [ ] Mutliple background/color scheme options.
