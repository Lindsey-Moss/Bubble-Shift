      <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
      <p class='tagline'>
        It really is like the classic game of Battleship: a turn-based, two-player, strategy-<i>like</i> (but mostly
        chance) guessing game.
      </p>
      <p class="tagline">Before the game begins, you'll place your <span class='bubbletext'>bubbles</span> of each size
        (5,
        4, 3, and 2) on
        <span class="focus">your board</span>. You can rotate them vertically or horizontally and place them however you
        likeâ€” so long as they
        don't overlap each other or fall off the board! When you're satisfied with how you've strategically (or
        aesthetically) placed your bubbles, the game will begin!
      </p>
      <p class='tagline'>
        On your turn, you check your <span class="focus">opponent's map</span> and make a guess at where your
        opponent's bubbles might be hidden! Just point and click to make your guess. <font color="gray">(You can only
          guess once per turn,
          so choose wisely!)</font> We'll then let you know whether your guess was a "hit" or a "miss"!
      </p>
      <p class="tagline">
        Then it'll be your opponent's turn. And they'll do the same thing! They'll look at their map of your board and
        make a guess, and we'll let you both know whether their guess was a hit or miss, too!
      </p>
      <p class="tagline">It'll be pretty clear which is which: Hits will be colored <font color="red"><b>red</b></font>,
        and misses
        will be solid <b>black</b>! Don't worry, we'll keep track of both for you, and you can't choose the same
        spot twice. ;) Whew!</p>
      <p class="clincher">Whoever pops allâ€” 14, total!â€” of their opponent's bubbles first, wins!</p>
