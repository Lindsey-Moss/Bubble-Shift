      <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
      <p class='tagline'>
        It really is like the classic game of Battleship: a turn-based, two-player, strategy-<i>like</i> (but mostly
        chance) guessing game.
      </p>
      <p class="tagline">Before the game begins, you'll place your <span class='bubble'>bubbles</span> of each size (5,
        4, 3, and 2) on
        <span class="focus">your board</span>. You can rotate them vertically or horizontally and place them however you
        like— so long as they
        don't overlap each other or fall off the board! When you're satisfied with how you've strategically (or
        aesthetically) placed your bubbles, the game will begin!
      </p>
      <p class='tagline'>
        On your turn, you check your <span class="focus">opponent's map</span> and make a guess at where your
        opponent's bubbles might be hidden! Just point and click to make your guess. <font color="gray">(You can only
          guess once per turn,
          so choose wisely!)</font> We'll then let you know whether your guess was a "hit" or a "miss"!
      </p>
      <p class="tagline">
        Then it'll be your opponent's turn. And they'll do the same thing! They'll look at their map of your board and
        make a guess, and we'll let you both know whether their guess was a hit or miss, too!
      </p>
      <p class="tagline">It'll be pretty clear which is which: Hits will be colored <font color="red"><b>red</b></font>,
        and misses
        will be solid <b>black</b>! Don't worry, we'll keep track of both for you, and you can't choose the same
        spot twice. ;) Whew!</p>
      <p class="clincher">Whoever pops all— 14, total!— of their opponent's bubbles first, wins!</p>
